# PennyTS

Pennybot for Discord but in TypeScript

# NOTE

This repo is not meant for people to steal as their own bot. That's not very nice. On that same note;
Everyone is free to fork and make edits to this bot to PR and help us to develop Penny further as she continues to grow.
This bot has taken me 3+ years of work and I am very proud of this rewrite and I am very thankful to my contributors
for helping to make it all possible. This repo is here as a means to show the world what we have worked on and what I have made.
Drop a star if you enjoy.
